# Hello World <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 

I'm Alexandre Segault, a web developper located in Orléans, France. Specialized in JavaScript with React.js as front-end framework / library (or whatever) and Node.js && Express as Back-end framework. Currently learning python, I will in the meantime go for a css framework like SASS or style-components to keep feeding my curiosity.
